/*
    CIN(cin) stops the execution when it encounters space(" "),tab("\t"),
    and newline("\n"),in these three cases ..


  Note:suppose there is wriiten a sentence "my name is khan" , and we want the 
       whole sentence then how will we do it?

     >>if we want to store it in the character array,then we have to use the
      ****>>'cin.getline' 
       like, cin.getline(str,len);


       check how to use CUSTOM DELIMETER?

*/


/*
    Now in character array we have learnt, char ch[10];
    which also has in-built functions

    ...inbuilt functions are alraedy present and we use it in many ways.


LENGTH
    >>suppose we have to find the length then we will store the length inside 
    the varible ,that is: 
                            int len=sterlen(name);//found the length

COMPARE
    now we want to compare two strings..one is s1 and other is s2 i.e.compare(s1,s2)

      ...we can use the function:
                                    strcmp(s1,s2);

        it will give !=0...when it is not equal
        else it will be equal..

COPY
    if we want to copy the srring then,we will write 'strcpy',and first argument
    will be destination string and second destination will be source string..

       :

            strcpy(dest,src);

            means we will copy from source string to destn string...
