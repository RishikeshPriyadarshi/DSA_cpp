STATIC FUNCTIONS:

> "There is no need to create Object we can simply call 
  it by using class name "..

>"It does not have "this" keyword"...
  because "this keyword is pointer to current object"

  so if there is NO Current Object a/c to line 3,then 
  how "this" pointer will be created 


>"static functions" can only access "static member" only..
