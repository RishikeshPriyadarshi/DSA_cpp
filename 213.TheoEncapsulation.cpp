ENCAPSULATION:

"Wrapping Up data members and functions " and the 
single entity comes after wrapping data members and funcns
then we can say we have achived Encapsulation

/*
  Data Members --->Properties

  Functions---->Methods or Behaviours

*/


So "Class is a Capsule " (entity) under which members and funcns
wrapped, and by this Capsule we achieve Encapsukation


----------------------------------------------------

FULLY ENCAPSULATED CLASS?

>In Fully Encapsulated Class "all Data-Members r PRIIVATE"

ex; 

    private: //Means same class me hi access kr payenge

    int num;
    string label;
------------------------------------------------------------


Why do we need this?

Advantages:
>Encapsulation synonym is "Information Hiding" or "Data Hiding"
so its help in data hiding

if we mark private,
then no other class can access the level or numbers

if we remove "getter/setter" from picture ,then we cannot 
directly class.., because it marked privately


>"and so it increase SECURITY"....

..... We can mark our class "read only", if we have marked private
   Then how can we can Access the particular memeber?
   ...>By usin "GETTER"
     so if we make "getter i.e. get" then we will be able to read it..

 And "if we don't make the SETTER",then we can't change it" 
>      we can make class read only....


>We can "Reuse the code"..

>used for "UNIT TESTING"..
