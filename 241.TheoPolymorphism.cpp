                POLYMORPHISM
                ------------

Poly means "Many"

Morph means "Forms"

it is basically means "EXISTING in MANY(MULTIPLE) FORMS"


for ex:

Talking about "FATHER"

>Father is Husband for Mother
>father is Son     for Grand-Mother
>Father is Brother for Bua  

    etc............


So "Father is existing in Multiple Forms"
